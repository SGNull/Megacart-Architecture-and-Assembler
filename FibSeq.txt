//Fibbonacci sequence generator program!
//IMPORTANT NOTE: This program is written for the V1 Architecture. This will not work in the V2 architecture.

//First, let's load 1 into A, 0 into B
ALU A 1
ALU B A-1
MFB IO

//Next, the main loop. First we do b=a+b, then we do a=a+b
//Note: the s at the end of A+B is to store the carry
:main
MFA IO
ALU B A+Bs
JIF carry EndLoc
MFB IO

ALU A A+Bs
JIF !carry main

//Finally, it stops before it overflows
:EndLoc
END .
